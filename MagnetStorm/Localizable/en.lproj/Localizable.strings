\nThe level of geomagnetic activity is measured using the planetary G index, and the intensity of the aurora is expressed in gigawatts (GW). The G index ranges from 0 to 9, and the intensity of the aurora varies from lower values to higher ones.
\nIt should be noted that there are moments when these relationships do not hold exactly.";

\nIt is important to note that if you are beneath the aurora in the right place, you can enjoy beautiful auroral displays even during low geomagnetic activity (G = 2 or 3).";

These hours of auroral activity expand towards the evening and morning as the level of geomagnetic activity increases. Although the aurora may be visible in the evening and morning, it is usually less active and, therefore, less visually appealing.
\nThe most favorable seasons for northern lights observation are around the spring and fall equinoxes.";
